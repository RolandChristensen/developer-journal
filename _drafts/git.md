# Git for Local Development
Git is awesome for source control and is essential to working in a group, but it is also extremely helpful for local development.

Reasons for source control 
* You can see a diff of any changes made, to prevent accidental changes
* You can create a branch to experiment and if you do not like the results, you can simply undo all changes in a single step

## Git Fork
Use `git fork` when you do not have permission to contribute to the repository.

A *clone* of a repository assumes you can create a pull request and modify the original repo, while a *fork* assumes you will be taking a fork in the road and all subsequent changes are separate from the parent repo. "Thanks for the start, I really appreciate it, but I want to take this in my own direction."

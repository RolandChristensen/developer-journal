GIT and GitHub related notes

## Git Fork
Use `git fork` when you do not have permission to contribute to the repository.

A *clone* of a repository assumes you can create a pull request and modify the original repo, while a *fork* assumes you will be taking a fork in the road and all subsequent changes are separate from the parent repo. "Thanks for the start, I really appreciate it, but I want to take this in my own direction."

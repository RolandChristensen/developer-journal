# Console Applications :)
From your favorite IDE
```C
// Check out all the fun things (methods) you can explore in the Console class.
Console.
```

The period or dot (.) is the "member access operator" or "dot operator"

```C
Console.Writeline("Hello :)");

Console.Write("Hello");
Console.Write(" ");
Console.Write(":)");
```

The parentheses are known as the "method invocation operator" and hold the parameters passed to the method.

The semicolon is the "end of statement operator" and is needed in the C languages to indicate the end of an instruction for the compiler.

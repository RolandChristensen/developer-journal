TestOps notes

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TestOps

# Test Operations
* Planning
* Management (organization and governance, tools, test environment, test lifecycle [efficient and scalable])
* Control (Source control, collaboration tools, ownership)
* Insights (data, coverage, risk analysis)

## Test Automation Pyramid
As you ascend the pyramid, the tests become more costly in resources for creation, maintenance, and time and computing resources to run.

1. Unit Test (10000's)
2. Integration Tests (1000's)
3. End to End (e2e) (100's)

## Manual Testing
* Slower than automated
* Tedious and error prone
* Costly

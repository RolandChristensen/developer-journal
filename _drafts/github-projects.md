Project Management Light (But Being Developed)

Project management concepts are not discussed in the docs. Basic knowledge is a pre-requisite or the willingness to learn independently.

* You can add custom fields (Metadata) to items such as:
    * Date fields
    * Number fields
    * Select fields
    * Text fields
    * Iteration field
* Automations to do things on field changes, via the API, or using GitHub Actions
* Tasklists allow you to create issue hierarchies, sub-tasks, and relations between issues.
* Create *views* to query project and save for future use.

# Create New Personal User Project

## Kanban Divergence 
Kanban is Japanese for "Visual Signal"

Kanban lets you see your work clearly so the team can all stay on the same page.

Bare necessities:
* Kanban Board
* Kanban Cards
* Work in Progress Limit

Basic Board:

|Backlog|Ready|Doing|Blocked|Review|Done|
|-------|-----|-----|-------|------|----|
|Story 1|     |     |       |    |  |

**workflow**: the left to right flow of a story to the **Done** state.  
Each time a card makes it to **Done** you are able to pick up a new story and pull it into the **Today** (Working/Doing/In Progress/...) column.  
As stories build up in one column or another, you will identify bottlenecks.  
You should also begin to create cards with reasonable sizes that can be moved forward in a timely manner.  
**Lead Time**: The time taken from the time you start working on it to the time its done (in production).
